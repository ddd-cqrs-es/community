# Community


We're moving the community to Discord for a variety of reasons.

Join the server here: https://discord.gg/sEZGSHNNbH
The decommission plan:
* [x] This announcement
* [ ] Sept 1st 2022: start deleting channels.
* [ ] End of year 2022: delete the slack workspace

Note: there will be no retention of data of any kind - messages, member lists, email addresses etc.
There's a thread in #general and a #slack-migration channel in discord if you have something you wish to contribute.
