# Community

We have moved the community to Discord for a variety of reasons.

- Join the server here: https://discord.gg/sEZGSHNNbH
- [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
- [Community Moderators](moderators.md)

The decommission plan is now complete:
* [x] This announcement
* [x] Sept 1st 2022: start deleting channels.
* [x] End of year 2022: delete [the Slack workspace](https://ddd-cqrs-es.slack.com)

Note: There will be no retention of data of any kind - messages, member lists, email addresses etc.
There's a thread in #general and a #slack-migration channel in Discord if you have something you wish to contribute.
